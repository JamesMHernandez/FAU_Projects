<p>
  This project is about classifying different types of flowers found around Florida through the use of the alexnet convolutional neural network.
  <br>
  The dataset is comprised of 11 types of flowers found around Florida, predominantly from the Boca Raton region.
  <br>
  The total number of images in this dataset is currently 55 and more will be added over time. This will include not only more images of current species, but also introduce more species into the model.
  <br>
  Proper lables are currently being implemented for the current flowers.    <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mSechdRza74pQrA6R7HXVbk1Tpj-tmfA?usp=sharing"> Colab Notebook </a>
