  This project is focused on using alexnet to classify whether an image was taken in a video game environment or in real life.
</p>

<p>
  The idea for this project stemmed from the idea that computer generated images and environments are becoming increasingly hyper-realistic, and the average person can struggle to discern the difference between real and fake images.
</p>

<p>
  The dataset for this project contains images of city/urban areas from video game locations that are modeled after real life areas. Some cities within the dataset include: Chicago, London, and Los Angeles to name a few.
